# UNION: Between Layers

**Genre:** Single-player, narrative-driven 2D adventure  
**Engine:** Ebitengine  
**Jam:** Ebitengine Game Jam 2025  
**Theme:** UNION (結合・和集合・同盟)

## Overview

_UNION: Between Layers_ is a single-player exploration game set in a fractured world. Reality has splintered into three overlapping dimensions—Mind, Heart, and Body. As a silent traveler, the player must navigate these realms, recover lost fragments of self, and restore unity.

This is a game about reassembly—of memory, space, identity. There is no dialogue, no combat, and no external guidance. What remains is movement, atmosphere, and meaning drawn from environment alone.

## Core Concept

You awaken in the echo of a world long gone. Its form is broken, its essence divided. Three layers persist:

- **Mind**: Abstract logic and dreamlike architecture. Gravity shifts, space folds, paths defy reason.
- **Heart**: Emotionally-charged terrain shaped by memories, longing, and loss.
- **Body**: Tangible remnants of civilization. Machinery broken, structures collapsed, time frozen.

Each layer contains pieces of a shattered whole. They are not locked—they are forgotten.

## Gameplay

- Movement-based progression, no combat
- Each layer has its own traversal logic and environmental rules
- Fragments are hidden throughout each dimension
- Player gains new abilities through reassembly (e.g. reversing gravity, phasing through illusions)
- Layer transitions affect the shared structure of the world
- Environmental storytelling and visual cues drive narrative

## Visual Style

- **Mind**: shifting geometry, layered patterns, low-contrast glow
- **Heart**: warm, unstable lighting with flowing forms
- **Body**: decayed industry, static shadows, metallic ruins

Minimalist UI. No spoken text or dialogue. All narrative is visual or symbolic.

## Development Scope

- Single-player, offline
- Designed for simplicity in controls, complexity in structure
- No procedural generation, AI, or online features
- Progress tracked via simple flags and state conditions
- Built using Ebitengine and Go

## End State

As fragments reunite, the layers converge. The world reshapes itself—or doesn’t.  
The final decision belongs to the player:

- Reconstruct
- Abandon
- Transcend

**UNION** is not given. It is chosen.
